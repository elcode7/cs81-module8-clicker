## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?
Working directly with `document.getElementById` and seeing how changing `textContent` updates the page immediately helped me understand how JavaScript interacts with the DOM.  
## How did you choose your milestone messages?
I chose messages that reflect a sense of progress and fun. 
## What challenge or bug surprised you?
I was surprised by how easy it is to accidentally use `innerText` instead of `textContent` and get slightly different behavior.  
## What personal twist did you add?
I added background color changes at each milestone to make the page feel more dynamic.  
## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?
Many apps use this type of interaction, including mobile games that reward clicks or taps, “like” buttons on social media platforms, and progress trackers.
